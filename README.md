# Sprite Fixer

A program designed to work with the output of my [Sprite Extractor](https://github.com/Danjb1/sprite-extractor) to consolidate any duplicate sprites and fix any highlighted pixels.

![Example](/docs/example.png)

## Compile

From the `src` directory:

    javac main/*.java

## Run

From the `src` directory:

    java main.SpriteExtractor SOURCE_DIR

Images are saved to an `out` directory.

### Example

    java main.SpriteExtractor input_images
